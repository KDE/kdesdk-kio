kio_perldoc - A kioslave interface to the imbedded Perl documentation.

Version: 0.9.1

It requires Perl 5.8 and the perl standard perldoc program to be installed.

Also required is the Switch module (emulates the Perl 6 switch feature in Perl 6).  It
looks to me like it's also included with Perl 5.8, but if this doesn't work, try that
first.

It uses a stripped-down version of the Pod::HtmlEasy module from CPAN, by M. P.
Graciliano and Geoffrey Leach. (Specifically, the 0.9 version)

This code started off as a KDevelop addon (and if you have KDevelop installed, you
also already have a perldoc KIOSlave installed!!  Don't overwrite it unless you know
what you're doing!)

This version is improved however.

Installing:
This KIOSlave is for KDE 4, and it requires CMake to build.  Installing is
about as easy as:

$ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kde4 (Replace /opt/kde4 with your KDE 4 prefix)
$ make && make install (or sudo make install as appropriate)

You may have to run kbuildsycoca4 to pick up the .protocol file.

Usage:
In konq: perldoc:/functions/foo to get the perldoc info for the given perl function
(as if you ran perldoc -f foo).

or, perldoc:/faq/search_terms to search perlfaq* for the given search terms, and display
all the matches.  (like perldoc -q foo)

Finally, perldoc:/foo will show the perldoc results just as if you ran perldoc foo.
Both module names (i.e. Test::More) and pod pages (i.e. perl58delta) work.

TODO:
 * If a faq or function is not found you currently just get a very empty page.
 * Probably not quite up to par for translators. :(
 * Looks like perl.com, it should look like kde.org, however the CSS can be changed
   fairly easily so this may be easy to fix.

This is for KDE 4.  The port from KDE 3 wasn't too hard.
