0.9.1:
* Actually works on KDE 4.  A function needed to be specially exported, forgetting to do so
  happened to work on KDE 3 and early versions of KDE 4 but that was never guaranteed.
* Add guard to only use gcc extension if compiling with gcc.

0.9: Initial KDE 4 release.
* Port to KDE 4.
* Add kio_perldoc to GENERATOR metainfo.
* Better output for non-breaking spaces.
* Don't try to load IMG tags.
* Fix formatting of bulleted lists. (Patch from Bruce Ravel)
* Use ::foo() form of C functions everywhere.
* Correct call to execlp().  The same concerns apply to it as applied to
  execl().  This stops the command from actually trying to show a man page when
  kdeinit is started from a tty.
* Don't add the HTML page name for hyperlinks that point to the same page.  First off,
  we sometimes do it wrong and break the link, and second of all, it's simply less
  efficient to force a reload of the same page.
* Improve HTML output formatting.  Looks more like www.kde.org although I opted not to
  add the KDE header to the output.

0.8: Initial KDE 3 release.
