kio_perldoc - A KIO worker interface to the embedded Perl documentation.

It requires Perl 5.10 and the perl standard perldoc program to be installed.

Also required is the Switch module (emulates the Perl 6 switch feature in Perl 6).  It
looks to me like it's also included with Perl 5.8, but if this doesn't work, try that
first.

It uses a stripped-down version of the Pod::HtmlEasy module from CPAN, by M. P.
Graciliano and Geoffrey Leach. (Specifically, the 0.9 version)

Installing:
This KIO worker is for KF KIO 5, and it requires CMake to build.  Installing is
about as easy as:

$ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kf5 (Replace /opt/kf5 with your KF5 prefix)
$ make && make install (or sudo make install as appropriate)

Usage:
In konq: perldoc:/functions/foo to get the perldoc info for the given perl function
(as if you ran perldoc -f foo).

or, perldoc:/faq/search_terms to search perlfaq* for the given search terms, and display
all the matches.  (like perldoc -q foo)

Finally, perldoc:/foo will show the perldoc results just as if you ran perldoc foo.
Both module names (i.e. Test::More) and pod pages (i.e. perl58delta) work.

TODO:
 * If a faq or function is not found you currently just get a very empty page.
 * Probably not quite up to par for translators. :(
 * Looks like perl.com, it should look like kde.org, however the CSS can be changed
   fairly easily so this may be easy to fix.
