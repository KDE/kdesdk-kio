This is a kio_subersion. It allows you to browse a (remote) Subversion repositery. 
The expected URLs are something like : svn://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
This will show you the current HEAD version of the repositery (just like the one you would get 
with http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn). 
You can also try : svn://svn.collab.net/repos/svn?rev=500 so that it displays the revision 500.

INSTALL:
--------
you need the svn client library which is distributed by subversion. 
on Debian : apt-get install libsvn0-dev will do everything you need.

then you need kdenonbeta/admin and kdenonbeta/kio_svn, then :
make -f Makefile.cvs
./configure --enable-svnsupport
make

will compile it
and make install with superkarma.

FUTURE:
-------
I will work on the ::special kioslave to method add checkout, update, commits abilities and some others.
Then we will be able to work with gideon and cervisia to see how to integrate it (some kind of cvsservice maybe).

Another step forward will be to be able to browse https repositeries, local repositeries and svnserve repositeries.

BUGS:
-----
- authentication support seems broken ...
- can't copy files from svn:// URLs to local filesystem, dunno why yet ...

STATUS:
-------
::listDir OK
::stat    OK
::get     OK
::copy    test
